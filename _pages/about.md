Hello!

I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in the Department of **Computer Science** at  **University of Rochester**, advised by [John Criswell](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/criswell/ "John Criswell"). I also serve the department community as the **Events Chair,** hosting regular community-building events!

I grew up in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and (besides research) I enjoy talking about coffee and new recipes!

## Research Interests
I work in systems security. I have worked with **compiler** and **operating systems** solutions to **hardware threats** such as design-time hardware bugs. More recently I've gained significant interest in applying **formal methods** to specify and translate security between system abstractions such as the ISA and microarchitecture. I'm currently investigating techniques for translating formally specified architecture-based security policies to the gate-level to preempt placement of stealthy, yet devastating, hardware trojans.

## Education
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, **University of Rochester**, May 2022 (expected)
* M.S in Computer Science, **University of Rochester**, May 2018
* B.S in Computer Science, **Rutgers University**, May 2014

## Experience
* **University of Rochester** _Research Assistant_ (Sept 2016 - May 2022)
* **Pacific Northwest National Laboratory** _Intern_ (March - July 2020)
* **MIT Lincoln Laboratory** _Intern_ (June - Sept 2018, May - Aug 2019)
* **AcquireMedia** _Software Engineer_ (June 2015 - Aug 2016)
* **Rutgers University** _Undergraduate Assistant Researcher_ (Sept 2012 - Dec 2013)

## Community

* **Microsoft** _Technical Evangelist_ Sept 2013 - June 2014

## Collaboration
Let's talk about research! I'm always eager to meet new potential collaborators. I have an itch to work on formal reasoning over quantum systems. The best way to reach me is through email.
